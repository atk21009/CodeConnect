# Code Connect

Javascript was the primary language used in this application to add functionality to my web application to create an authentication system that stores users' emails and data, sends out emails to users, updates recent news articles, and additional features.

Code Connect is an open platform application aimed at beginner, intermediate, and advanced programmers. The idea of this program is to give resources to programmers so that they can connect with others and also improve their skills.
